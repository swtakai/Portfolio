<p>I am currently a Junior in the School of Information at the University of Michigan with a focus on Information Analysis. Outside of academics, I am the current Vice-President and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/michiganeqteam/?hl=en" target="_blank">Social Media</a> coordinator for the Michigan Equestrian Team, as well as the former Social Coordinator.</p>

<p>I am also a competitive Equestrian on the hunter/jumper circuits. As a junior rider, I competed mainly in the hunter and equitation rings. As an amateur rider I have started competing in the jumper ring. I have competed all across the midwest and east coast, and have attended 3 national and 2 regional finals.</p>

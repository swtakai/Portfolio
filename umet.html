	<p>The Michigan Equestrian Team accepts all levels of riders. We have competing and non-competing members. Our competition team competes in Zone 6 Region 4 of the <a href="https://www.ihsainc.com/about-us/general-information" target="_blank">Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA)</a>. Our team consistently places in the top 5 in the region with many of our members qualifying for Regionals, Zones and Nationals each year.</p>
	<p>Our team trains at Willowbrooke Farms in Plymouth, MI with Jennifer Blades. The team usually has around 50 members every year with around 20 competing members. All of our members attend practices once every other week. In order to get used to the IHSA format, we switch and ride 3 horses each practice. In addition to lessons, many of our team members take extra lessons 1-3 times per week.</p>
	<p>I have been a member of the Michigan Equestrian Team since freshman year. In my sophomore year, I served as the Social Coordinator. This year I am the Vice President as well as the Social Media Coordinator. Next year I will be the President. I compete in the Intermediate Flat and Over Fences, and have competed at Regionals.</p>
